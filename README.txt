Using Python in the Android scripting layer it is possible to log your phone's location to a remote PostGIS server over a network connection. To communicate with PostGIS I used a tweaked version of the pg8000 PostgreSQL interface. The pg8000 stack is written in pure Python meaning that it can be included in Android python scripts as it has no external dependencies. PostGISDroid is a prototype script, developed and tested on a HTC Wildfire-S running Android 2.3.3 and Python 2.6.2.
