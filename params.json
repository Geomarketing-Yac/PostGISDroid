{"name":"PostGISDroid","body":"Using Python in the Android scripting layer it is possible to log your phone's location to a remote PostGIS server over a network connection. To communicate with PostGIS I used a tweaked version of the [pg8000](http://pybrary.net/pg8000/) PostgreSQL interface. The pg8000 stack is written in pure Python meaning that it can be included in Android python scripts as it has no external dependencies. For an overview of Python scripting in Android see the [Android Sciprting Pages](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/), you can find links to this tutorial and others on the [site's wiki](http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/Tutorials). I developed and tested this prototype script on a HTC Wildfire-S running Android 2.3.3 and Python 2.6.2.
